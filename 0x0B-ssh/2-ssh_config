# This is the system-wide configuration file for the SSH client.  For more details, see # ssh_config(5).  Users can override the default values in this file's per-user #configuration files or on the command line.

# The following is how configuration data is parsed:
# first, the command-line options
# User-specific file
# 3 System-wide file 
# Any configuration value only undergoes a change when it is initially set.
# The # configuration file should therefore start with host-specific definitions and #finish with defaults.

# Global defaults for a few often used settings.  Please read the following link for a #complete list of all accessible options, their descriptions, and default values:
